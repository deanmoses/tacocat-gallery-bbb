##Backbone Boilerplate##

This project uses Backbone Boilerplate to organize its files and do its build process.

View the Backbone Boilerplate documentation here:

[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/wiki)

## Build process ##

This uses a development-time build process command line tool called 'bbb' (Backbone Boilerplate Build tool).

It's based off of GruntJS, but comes out of the box with most of the plugins it needs.

Look at the  
[grunt-bbb](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/grunt-bbb)
plugin repo and follow the instructions to install.
